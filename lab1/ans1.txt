1. man -k [WORD]
I searched through "man man" and tested the command on lnxsrv to
confirm its operation.

2. mv: /usr/bin/mv	sh: /usr/bin/sh
I used the commands "which mv" and "which sh" to find these

3. Programs: tr, ar, pr
/usr/bin/tr:
Translate or delete characters

/usr/bin/ar:
Create, modify, and extract from archives

/usr/bin/pr:
Convert text files for printing

I used "find /usr/bin -name "?r" -executable" to locate the above programs, and then used whatis on each program to identify what they do
